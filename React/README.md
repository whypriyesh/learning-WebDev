- **06-tailwind** - Tailwind CSS integration
- **07-ui-project** - UI/UX project implementation

### JavaScript & Functions
- **08-functions** - Function handling in React components

### State Management (Beginner)
- **09-useState** - Introduction to useState hook
- **10-usestate-advance** - Advanced useState patterns

### Forms & User Input
- **11-form-handling** - Form handling techniques
- **12-two-way-binding** - Two-way data binding

### Data Persistence & Projects
- **13-notes-app** - Building a notes application
- **14-localstorage** - Using browser LocalStorage API

### Advanced Concepts
- **15-api-calling** - Making API calls and handling responses
- **16-useeffect** - Understanding the useEffect hook
- **17-gallery-project** - Building an image gallery

### Routing & Navigation

- **19-routing-advanced** - Advanced routing patterns

### State Management (Advanced)
- **21-context-api** - Context API for global state
- **20-bonus-topic** - Additional advanced topics

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project folder is a standalone Vite + React application. To run any project:

```bash
cd [project-folder]
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173/`

## 🎯 Learning Progression

This learning journey follows this progression:

1. **Foundation** - Understanding React basics, components, and JSX
2. **Styling** - Learning different approaches to styling (CSS, Tailwind)
3. **Interactivity** - Managing state and handling user interactions
4. **Persistence** - Working with LocalStorage and APIs
5. **Side Effects** - Understanding lifecycle with useEffect
6. **Navigation** - Building multi-page applications with routing
7. **Global State** - Managing application-wide state with Context API

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **LocalStorage API** - Browser data persistence
- **REST APIs** - External data fetching

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is a personal learning record created by **Priyesh** while studying React development. Each project builds upon previous concepts and introduces new ones progressively. The code represents my learning journey and evolution as a React developer.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
